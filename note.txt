EOF appears at the end of input.
existence of NULL character at front of EOF is not guaranteed.

EOF is just a indicator so it can't be printed out.

scanf("%[^\n]", str)
char array str doesn't include '\n' in given format.

frequent use of IO functions lowers performance of program.
then what is worse along input and output?

try different IDEs and OSs.
