EOF appears at the end of input.
existence of NULL character at front of EOF is not guaranteed.

EOF is just a indicator so it can't be printed out.

scanf("%[^\n]", str)
char array str doesn't include '\n' in given format.

frequent use of IO functions lowers performance of program.
then what is worse along input and output?
